# Valax321 Audio System
An improved audio system for Unity built on top of the built-in audio components.
This system offers more flexibility for playing sounds and organising them into assets. You can randomise playback of a set of audio clips purely through the editor and dynamically play sounds in a flexible way with a single line of code.
